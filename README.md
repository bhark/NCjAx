# Neural Cellular Automata as computing substrate

> [!NOTE]
> This is a WIP. It is, at the moment, completely undocumented and pretty unreliable. 


Inspired by the Distill paper [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/), this library attempts to use NCA as a substrate for computing. It provides everything needed to create, write to, read from and grow an NCA substrate. It is intentionally lean - bring your own training routine.
