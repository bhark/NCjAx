# Neural Cellular Automata as computing substrate

> [!NOTE]
> This is a WIP. It is, at the moment, completely undocumented and not super robust. It does work if you're brave enough.  


Inspired by [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/) and [Towards self-organized control: Using neural cellular automata to robustly control a cart-pole agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15240) (Variengien et. al.), this library attempts to use NCA as a substrate for computing. It provides everything needed to create, write to, read from and grow an NCA substrate. It is intentionally lean - bring your own training routine.
